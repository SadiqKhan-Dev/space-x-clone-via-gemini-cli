# SpaceX Replica

## Description
This project is a simple replica of the SpaceX website, designed to showcase a responsive web layout. It features a dynamic navigation bar, a mobile-friendly sidebar accessible via a hamburger menu, and five distinct content sections. These sections alternate between captivating video backgrounds and striking image backgrounds to create an immersive user experience.

## Features
*   **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Mobile Sidebar with Hamburger Menu:** A user-friendly hamburger menu toggles a sidebar navigation on smaller screens, enhancing mobile usability.
*   **Dynamic Background Sections:** Five unique sections, with alternating video and image backgrounds, designed to engage users.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links within sections provide calls to action.

## Technologies Used
*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the layout, responsiveness, and visual design.
*   **JavaScript:** For interactive elements, specifically the mobile menu toggle functionality.

## Setup and Installation

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository if it's hosted, otherwise, you can skip this step if you have the files locally.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd space-x-gemini-cli
